# Order Management View Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a comprehensive Order Management system for your SAP UI5 application with all the requested features:

## Features Implemented

### 1. Order List View (`OrderListView5.view.xml`)

- **Comprehensive Order Table**: Displays orders from `/Orders` entity with:
  - Order ID
  - Customer Name (Company Name and Contact Name)
  - Employee (Sales Representative)

### 2. Advanced Filtering System

  - Date Range (From/To dates)
  - Customer selection (dropdown with all customers)
  - Employee selection (dropdown with all employees/sales reps)
  - Shipper selection (dropdown with all shippers)
  - Apply/Clear filter buttons

### 3. Search and Navigation

- **Search Field**: Global search across Order ID, Customer Name, Employee Name, and Shipper
- **Row Navigation**: Click on any order row to navigate to Order Detail page
- **Responsive Design**: Table columns collapse on smaller screens

### 4. Order Detail View (`OrderDetailView6.view.xml`)

- **Order Header**: Shows order summary with freight cost and status
- **Customer Information**: Display customer and contact details
- **Employee Information**: Shows sales representative details
- **Shipping Information**: Complete shipping address and details

  - Order grand total

### 5. Create Order Dialog (`CreateOrderDialog.fragment.xml`)

- **Modal Dialog** for creating new orders
- **Form Fields**:
  - Customer selection (required)
  - Employee/Sales Rep selection (required)
  - Order date (required)
  - Required date
  - Shipper selection
  - Freight cost
  - Complete shipping address fields

## Technical Implementation

### Controllers

   - Data refresh

2. **OrderDetailView6.controller.js**:
